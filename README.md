# Education in the Age of A.I. 
Thoughts on why and how do we educate ourselves in the age of A.I. 

The goal of this post is to reflect on how education should evolve in the face of developments and applications of artificial intelligence.

More specificly, education in the age of AI can mean several things:

- Education ***with*** AI     -  How to improve learning and teaching with help from AI?
- Education ***of*** AI       -  How to define, build, apply, and audit AI?
- Education ***for*** AI      -  How to utilize AI and get accustomed to the age of AI?
- Education ***against*** AI  -  How to protect ourselves from the negative impact of AI?

### Chapters
1. What is the role/purpose of humans in the age of AI?
2. What do we need to master given our role/purpose?
3. How should we learn given what we need to master?
4. How do we create environments that facilitate learning?
5. Transition roadmaps to education in the age of AI
6. Immediate research and experimentation demands
7. Equity and ethics considerations

#### Inputs: 
How Far is Too Far? | The Age of A.I. (S1E1)
- Baby X -  Affective computing, building AI that can learn by themselves and relate with humans (collaboration is the greatest driving factor in human prosperity, collaboration between human and machine will lead us to new milestone)  (Mark Sagar - [SoulMachines](https://www.soulmachines.com/resources/research/baby-x/))
- I am my Data - (William Adams) Linking identity with data, having autonomy over one's own data; do people always want it to be accurate? a special time in the history that people need to determine what is real vs what is not (what does a digital replicant mean?);  
- Modern cyborgs - our decisions in everyday life is influenced by recommendations from machines. (Gil Weinberg, Jason Barnes) Georgia Tech. Music improvisation robot to prosthetic arm for limb-difference musicians. Human body integrates with a robot prosthetic arm. 
- Avatar - Hard to model personality, too many variations; Owner (Will Adams) think it should sound more robitic. Will there be a free will avatar.

Healed through A.I. | The Age of A.I. (S1E2)

- Tim Shaw / Speech Recognition for recognizing voices of people with ALS;  Ice bucket challenge add funding to ALS research but also get people's attention to contribute voice data, leading to Google to start Euphonia project. Record voice sample to help people. (Michael Brenner - Harvard) (Dimitri Kanevsky)

- Santhi / Image Processing for predicting blindness; Detect diabetic complications in early stage to  (Jessica Mega - Verily at Alphabet) (Dr. Kim Lily Peng - Google) speed up diagnosis. Make intelligence cheap for places where doctors are scarce.

- Detecting mental disorders (Rana El Kaliouby - Affectiva); Bran Ferren (Applied Minds); DeepMind and Google AI on Speech Synthesis 

Using A.I. to build a better human | The Age of A.I. (S1E3)

- Bionic legs that uses a computer that decides actuates the motors to balance; Create muscle/machine joint that goes bi-directional, user can control the leg while feeling the movements in neural systems. Natural dynamics (neurally and mechanically linked) motions make senses to user's brain. (Hugh Herr - MIT) 

- Sport "not just replace what is lost but enhance we already have"; Create stronger, smarter, faster people. Embedded sensors and use real-time data for strategic decision making. One of the superpower of humans is intuition;

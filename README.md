# Education in the Age of A.I. 
Thoughts on why and how do we educate ourselves in the age of A.I. 

The goal of this post is to reflect on how education should evolve in the face of developments and applications of artificial intelligence.

More specificly, education in the age of AI can mean several things:

- Education ***with*** AI     -  How to improve learning and teaching with help from AI?
- Education ***of*** AI       -  How to define, build, apply, and audit AI?
- Education ***for*** AI      -  How to utilize AI and get accustomed to the age of AI?
- Education ***against*** AI  -  How to protect ourselves from the negative impact of AI?

# Education in the Age of A.I. 
Thoughts on why and how do we educate ourselves in the age of A.I. 

The goal of this post is to reflect on how education should evolve in the face of developments and applications of artificial intelligence.

More specificly, education in the age of AI can mean several things:

- Education ***with*** AI     -  How to improve learning and teaching with help from AI?
- Education ***of*** AI       -  How to define, build, apply, and audit AI?
- Education ***for*** AI      -  How to utilize AI and get accustomed to the age of AI?
- Education ***against*** AI  -  How to protect ourselves from the negative impact of AI?

### Chapters
1. What is the role/purpose of humans in the age of AI?
2. What do we need to master given our role/purpose?
3. How should we learn given what we need to master?
4. How do we create environments that facilitate learning?
5. Transition roadmaps to education in the age of AI
6. Immediate research and experimentation demands
7. Equity and ethics considerations


### Chapter 1: 

#### Documentaries: 

**How Far is Too Far? | The Age of A.I. (S1E1)**

- Baby X -  Affective computing, building AI that can learn by themselves and relate with humans (collaboration is the greatest driving factor in human prosperity, collaboration between human and machine will lead us to new milestone)  (Mark Sagar - [SoulMachines](https://www.soulmachines.com/resources/research/baby-x/))
- I am my Data - (William Adams) Linking identity with data, having autonomy over one's own data; do people always want it to be accurate? a special time in the history that people need to determine what is real vs what is not (what does a digital replicant mean?);  
- Modern cyborgs - our decisions in everyday life is influenced by recommendations from machines. (Gil Weinberg, Jason Barnes) Georgia Tech. Music improvisation robot to prosthetic arm for limb-difference musicians. Human body integrates with a robot prosthetic arm. 
- Avatar - Hard to model personality, too many variations; Owner (Will Adams) think it should sound more robitic. Will there be a free will avatar.

**Healed through A.I. | The Age of A.I. (S1E2)**

- Tim Shaw / Speech Recognition for recognizing voices of people with ALS;  Ice bucket challenge add funding to ALS research but also get people's attention to contribute voice data, leading to Google to start Euphonia project. Record voice sample to help people. (Michael Brenner - Harvard) (Dimitri Kanevsky)

- Santhi / Image Processing for predicting blindness; Detect diabetic complications in early stage to  (Jessica Mega - Verily at Alphabet) (Dr. Kim Lily Peng - Google) speed up diagnosis. Make intelligence cheap for places where doctors are scarce.

- Detecting mental disorders (Rana El Kaliouby - Affectiva); Bran Ferren (Applied Minds); DeepMind and Google AI on Speech Synthesis 

**Using A.I. to build a better human | The Age of A.I. (S1E3)**

- Bionic legs that uses a computer that decides actuates the motors to balance; Create muscle/machine joint that goes bi-directional, user can control the leg while feeling the movements in neural systems. Natural dynamics (neurally and mechanically linked) motions make senses to user's brain. (Hugh Herr - MIT) 

- Sport "not just replace what is lost but enhance we already have"; Create stronger, smarter, faster people. Embedded sensors and use real-time data for strategic decision making. One of the superpower of humans is intuition;  

**In the Age of AI | FRONTLINE**

- (Yoshua Bengio) Most of human knowledge cannot be expressed in words, what we verbally communicates is a tip of the iceberg while people learn most of the knowledge through interactions. Computer scientists are like physicists who proposed nuclear bombs in the WWII. Collective wisdom and social norms to handle the new superpower, high stakes. 
 
- (Amy Webb - NYU Future Today Institue); AI has more computing power, remember more details, and can find and formalize patterns better; (Andrew Mcafee - MIT) Burst of social development scores - industrial revolution overcomes the limitation of our body, now AI revolution will breakthrough the limitation of our mind. Voice assistant not only recognizes you, but also create baseline and compare to see if your cadence changes, in the goal of micro-predicting your intimate, real-time statuses. "We don't have full agency, machine learns about us and use that to tell others who we are"

- (Steve Viscelli) The Big Rig Automatic Trucking promises lower costs and displacing the drivers. How AI changes labor force.

- (Nicholas Thompson - Wired) The magazine goes from a champion of technological change to an observer. Jony Ive, Jaron Lanier, Jeff Bezos. Sillicon Valley two thoughts: We simply trust technologies as the history before us shows that we are going to be fine; Others believe we will see an unprecedented labor force disruption, will people blame the creator of technologies?

- (Kai-Fu Lee - Sinovation) AI will replace 50% of jobs, including white-collar, blue-collar, and become symbiotic tools for other professions. White collars are easier to replace since they use purely quantitative analytical processes. Key milestones: steam engine, electricity, computer, AI. Two AI Superpowers; Sputinik moment when AlphaGo won; US China need to work together to make AI right, use it within the reasonable limit. 

- (Jerry Kaplan) Half of the historical occupations such as telephone operators are gone nowadays, so AI displacement is nothing to worry. (push back from Kai-Fu Lee being history is trustable only when we see multiple repetitions but not once-in-a-blue-moon occurrences) Use AI to be more efficient while efficiency means doing the same job with fewer workers. "Automation is a substitution of labor with capital." (from Jerry Kaplan) How do we distribute the economic benefits of automation. AI excerbates the economic inequality. 

- (Carl Frey and Michael Osborne - Oxford) 47% jobs could be automated. Historically, automation like this was the industrial revolution where wages of workers didn't grow for 9 decades and living standards went down. Robots replace jobs and don't pay tax, thus worsens the city facilities and living standards. No routine job left for the middle class to do. 

- (Mike Hicks, Emily Wornell) Automation as a silent job killer, off-shoring only accounts for 20% while most jobs in US are lost to automation. Job loss is leading to first and second generation impacts on people.

- (Molly Kinder = New America) Women disproportationally work in marginalized occupations at risk of automation such as cashiers and clerical work (processing papers and transfering data). 


- (Pedro Domingos) The master algorithms; the algorithm adapts to you without you needing to explicity express anything. Companies who develop these algorithms don't have the same goals as us. 

- (Shoshana Zuboff - Harvard Business School) "In the age of smart machine" to "surveillance capitalism". Industrial capitalism claimed nature and work as land for sold and labor to use. Surveillance capitalism tries to "claim private human experience as a free source of materials, fabricated into predictions of human behaviors." Google don't do evil slogan from the beginning. Advertising distorts purity of internet and search engine. Much greater details (behaviorial surplus) than we thought we have given out. "1) We can use cues in online environments to change real-world behaviors, 2) we can do this in a way that bypass user's awareness" Cambridge Analytica - billionares like Robert Mercer can buy their voice in politics.

- (Roger McNamee) Zucked; behaviorial prediction takes out randomness. Social contagion experiment 2010 election nudge people to vote. IoT things put surveillance into places we don't imagine before.

- (Kate Crawford - NYU AI Now Institute) Cambridge Analytica uses decade-old, first-wave data science technology while today's AI technology can do much better and control how information travels. AI systems are hidden into systems like hiring and bail decisions, hard to detect, how to make them transparent; 

- (Alistair Mactaggart) Privacy Legislation 1) right to know, 2) right to say no (don't sell my information), 3) opt-out any third-party usage, decision propagates through the network to prevent information spread

Title: Education in the Age of AI

Link: https://arcade.stanford.edu/blogs/education-age-ai

Author: Kathryn Hume - FastForwardLabs, University of Calgary, Stanford Comparative Literature Alumna

Publish Time: Not Found

Core Argument: "the right educational training and curriculum for the AI-enabled job market of the 21st century should create generalists, not specialists"

Skills: 
- Flexibility and Adaptability (Andrew Ng' quote, "The half-life of knowledge is decreasing" learn all life not just till college) (universities and MOOCs should help laymen update skills and stay relevant)
- Interdisciplinarity ("we mistake different ways of studying and asking questions for literally different things" leading to "prejudices against other tastes, interests, and preferences") (Stanford’s Thinking Matters and UChicago’s Social Thought - approach big questions multidisciplinarily)
- Model Thinking (humans use heuristic mental techniques to handle uncertainty (more in behaviorial econ and the book Undoing Project)) (but we need better statistical intuitions to understand how AI models model the world and impact our life) (important part of mandatory education)
- Synthetic and Analogical Reasoning ("AI systems aren’t analogical or synthetic reasoners") (cannot make connections on an abstracted level) (coursework in arts and humanities helps [The Utility of the Humanities in the 21st Century](https://quamproxime.com/2017/02/20/the-utility-of-the-humanities-in-the-21st-century/))
- Framing Qualitative Ideas as Quantitative Problems (speak human and speak machine, prioritize and estimate workload, render the messy real-world tractable for computation) (teach through case studies, university co-op training)
Additional context: people in society have evolved from generalists (hunter-gatherers) into specialists, who are more susceptible to AI replacement because AI excels at specialized tasks and such tasks only (for now, general AI attempts made at [OpenAI Universe](https://blog.openai.com/universe/) and [DeepMind Lab](https://deepmind.com/blog/open-sourcing-deepmind-lab/)). [a-history-and-future-of-the-rise-of-the-robots](https://hackernoon.com/a-history-and-future-of-the-rise-of-the-robots-cce0fe222a71). [five-distractions-in-thinking-about-ai](https://quamproxime.com/2017/03/25/five-distractions-in-thinking-about-ai/). 

Tim's comments: love the generalist advocacy (biased as I am more a generalist person) heard many complaining about being "a cog in the machine". First point on flexibility and adaptability is essentially about life-long learning, a topic needs more research. THe second point and fourth point are close and they reminds me of Project Base Learning PBL. Fifth and third points sound like formulation and interpretation, which are the I/O steps between business and tech, which needs interdisplinary knowledge.
